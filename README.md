**Flight Fare Prediction**

**Problem**
- We are given a dataset on Flight Fare.
- The dataset has information about the flight price for different routes and classes.
- Flight fare is determined dynamically based on various factors.
- We want to create a predictive model that can predict flight price based on it's features.

**Questions to be answered**
- How flight fare depends on:
    1. Flight Duration
    2. Demand
    3. No of stops
    4. Route
    5. No of days in advance the booking is made
    6. Time of Departure & Arrival
    7. CLass
- Finally we will create a model that can predict flight price

 **Technology Used**
 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
 - Regression Models
